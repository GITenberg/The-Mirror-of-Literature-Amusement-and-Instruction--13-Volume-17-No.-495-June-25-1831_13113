    <h2>HERMITAGE AT FROGMORE.</h2>

    <div class="figure" style="width:100%;">
      <a href="images/495-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/495-1.png"
      alt="Hermitage at Frogmore" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Frogmore is one of the most delightful of the still retreats of Royalty. It was
    formerly the seat of the Hon. Mrs. Egerton, of whom it was purchased by Queen
    Charlotte, in 1792, who made considerable additions to the house and gardens. The
    grounds were laid out by Uvedale Price, Esq. a celebrated person in the annals of
    picturesque gardening. The ornamental improvements were made by the direction of the
    Princess Elizabeth, (now Landgravine of Hesse Homburg,) whose taste for rural quiet
    we noticed in connexion with an Engraving of Her Royal Highness' Cottage, adjoining
    Old Windsor churchyard. <a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a
    href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

    <p>Frogmore occupies part of a fertile valley, which divides the Little Park from
    Windsor Forest, and comprises about thirteen acres. Mr. Hakewill describes it as
    "diversified with great skill and taste, and a piece of water winds throughout it
    with a pleasing variety of turn and shape. The trees and shrubs, both native and
    exotic, which spread their shade and diffuse their fragrance, are disposed with the
    best effect; while buildings are so placed as to enliven and give character to the
    general scene. The Ruin was designed by Mr. James Wyatt, and being seated on the bank
    of the water, as well as in part in the wood, it presents, with its creeping ivy and
    fractured buttresses, a most pleasing object from various points of the garden. The
    <i>Hermitage (see the Engraving)</i> is a small circular thatched building,
    completely embowered in lofty trees, and was constructed from a drawing of the
    Princess Elizabeth. There is also a Gothic Temple, sacred to solitude, and a
    well-imagined and picturesque barn, which heighten the appropriate scenery. Too much
    cannot be said of the secluded beauty of this charming spot, and nothing further need
    be said of the taste and judgment of Major Price, to whom its arrangements have been
    entrusted."</p>

    <p>The <i>Hermitage</i> contains a tablet spread with fruit, eggs, and bread, and a
    figure of a hermit reading the Scriptures; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page418"
    id="page418"></a>[pg 418]</span> at the entrance are the following lines, written on
    the marriage of the Princess Royal:&mdash;</p>

    <p>There are other affectionate testimonials in the grounds. The Gothic ruin contains
    an apartment fitted up as an oratory, ornamented with a copy of the Descent from the
    Cross, modelled in chalk, after the celebrated painting by Rembrandt; busts of George
    III. and the Duke of Kent; a posthumous marble figure of an infant child of his
    present Majesty; and an alto-relievo representing an ascending spirit attended by a
    guardian angel with the inscription&mdash;</p>

    <h3>ANCIENT WAGES TO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

    <h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Chamberlayne, in his <i>Angli&aelig; Notitia</i>, says, "Although the lords of
    parliament are to bear their own charges, because they represent there only
    themselves; yet all the commons, both lay and clergy, that is, <i>Procuratores
    Cleri</i>, are to have <i>rationales expensus</i>, (as the words of the writ are)
    that is, such allowance as the king considering the prices of all things, shall judge
    meet to impose upon the people to pay. In the 17th of Edward II. it was ten groats
    for knights, and five groats for burgesses; but not long after it was four shillings
    for all others, which in those days, as appears by the prices of all things, was a
    considerable sum, above ten times more than it is now, (1688) for not only then
    expenses were considered, though that was great by reason of the suitable attendance
    that then every parliament-man had, but also their pains, their loss of time, and
    necessary neglect of their own private affairs for the service of their country; and
    when the counties, cities, and boroughs paid so dear for their expenses, they were
    wont to take care to chuse such men as were best able, and most diligent in the
    speedy despatch of affairs; by which means, with some others, more business in those
    times was despatched in parliament in a week, than is now perhaps in ten; so that the
    protections for parliament-men and their servants from arrests were not then
    grievous, when scarce any parliament or sessions lasted so long as one of the four
    terms at Westminster.</p>

    <p>"The aforementioned expenses duly paid, did cause all the petty decayed boroughs
    of England to become humble suitors to the king, that they might not be obliged to
    send burgesses to parliament; whereby it came to pass, that divers were unburgessed,
    as it was in particular granted to <i>Chipping</i>, or <i>Market-Morriton</i>, upon
    their petition; and then the number of the <i>Commons House</i> being scarce half so
    many as at present, then debates and bills were sooner expedited." page 156, 21st.
    edit.</p>

    <p>Halsted, in his <i>History of Kent</i>, tells us, "The pay of the burgesses of
    Canterbury was fixed (anno 1411) at two shillings a-day for each, while such burgess
    was absent from his family attending his duty. In 1445 the wages were no more than
    twelve pence a-day; two years afterwards they were increased to sixteenpence, and in
    1503 had again been raised to two shillings. In Queen Mary's reign, the corporation
    refused to continue this payment any longer, and the wages of the members were then
    levied by assessment on the inhabitants at large, and continued to be so raised till
    these kinds of payments were altogether discontinued."</p>

    <h4>P.T.W.</h4>
    <hr />

    <h3>THE WORD "EI."</h3>

    <h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>

    <p>This word, which was engraven on the temple of Apollo, at Delphi, has occasioned
    much controversy among the literati. The learned and admirable Plutarch tells us that
    it means "thou art" as if "thou art one." The Langhornes, in their life of this
    philosopher, <a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a
    href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> attack his opinion as inconsistent with "the whole
    tenour of the Heathen Mythology." <span class="pagenum"><a name="page419"
    id="page419"></a>[pg 419]</span> It in to be observed, that the Greek word for
    priests is "[Greek: iereis]" (iereis). But I infer nothing from this; yet at the same
    time it is a remarkable circumstance. The objection of the Langhornes is frivolous;
    for the sun (Apollo) in most nations, was considered chief of the gods, and this
    inscription was placed to prove his <i>superiority and unity</i>.</p>

    <p>It is a very remarkable circumstance, that when the Pythia refused to enter the
    temple, at the application of Alexander, "Philip's godlike son," and he attempting to
    force her in, she exclaimed&mdash;"[Greek: Anikaetos ei o pai]" (My son, you are
    invincible.) Now, probably, she had some other intention in using that word; but,
    however, that does not affect the argument. I cannot but consider that Plutarch is
    right.</p>

    <h3>THE DEATH-BEDS OF GREAT MEN.</h3>

    <h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>

    <p>If there are any remarks which deserve to be recorded for the benefit of mankind,
    they are those which have been expressed on a dying bed, when, unfettered by
    prejudice or passion, Truth shines forth in her real colours. Sir John Hawkins has
    recorded of Dr. Johnson, that when suffering under that disease which ended in his
    dissolution, he addressed his friends in the following words:&mdash;"You see the
    state I am in, conflicting with bodily pain and mental distraction. While you are in
    health and strength, labour to do good, and avoid evil, if ever you wish to escape
    the distress that oppresses me."</p>

    <p>When Lord Lyttleton was on his death-bed, his daughter, Lady Valentia, and her
    husband, came to see him. He gave them his solemn benediction, adding&mdash;"Be good,
    be virtuous, my lord; you must come to this."</p>

    <p>The triumphant death of Addison will be remembered with feelings of pleasure by
    all. Having sent for the young Earl of Warwick, he affectionately pressed his hand,
    saying&mdash;"See in what peace a Christian can die!"</p>

    <p>The father of William Penn was opposed to his son's religious principles; but
    finding that he acted with sincerity, was at last reconciled. When dying, he adjured
    him to do nothing contrary to his conscience&mdash;"So," said he, "you will keep
    peace within, which will be a comfort in the day of trouble."</p>

    <p>Locke, the day before his death, addressed Lady Masham, who was sitting by his
    bedside, exhorting her to regard this world only as a state of preparation for a
    better. He added, that he had lived long enough, and expressed his gratitude to God
    for the happiness that had fallen to his lot.</p>

    <p>Tillotson, when dying, thanked his Maker that he felt his conscience at ease, and
    that he had nothing further to do but to await the will of Heaven.</p>

    <p>Sir Walter Raleigh behaved on the scaffold with the greatest composure. Having
    vindicated his conduct in an eloquent speech, he felt the edge of the axe, observing
    with a smile&mdash;"It is a sharp medicine, but a sure remedy, for all woes." Being
    asked which way he would lay himself on the block, he replied&mdash;"So the heart be
    right, it is no matter which way the head lies."</p>

    <p>Latimer, when he beheld a fagot ready kindled laid at Ridley's feet,
    exclaimed&mdash;"Be of good cheer, master Ridley, and play the man; we shall this day
    light such a candle in England, as I hope, by God's grace, shall never be put
    out."</p>

    <p>The author of Hervey's Meditations, when on his sick bed, observed that his time
    had been too much occupied in reading the historians, orators, and poets of ancient
    and modern times; and that were he to renew his studies, he <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page420" id="page420"></a>[pg 420]</span> would devote his attention to the
    Scriptures.</p>

    <p>The last words which the eminent physician Haller addressed to his medical
    attendant expressed the calm serenity of his mind. "My friend," said he, laying his
    hand on his pulse, "the artery no longer beats."</p>

    <p>M. De La Harpe, one of the first literary characters of the last century, who for
    many years laboured to spread the principles of the French philosophy, but afterwards
    became a most strenuous defender of Christianity, on the evening preceding his death
    was visited by a friend. He was listening to the Prayers for the Sick; as soon as
    they were concluded, he stretched forth his hand and said&mdash;"I am grateful to
    Divine mercy, for having left me sufficient recollection to feel how consoling these
    prayers are to the dying."</p>

    <p>Cardinal Wolsey, when dying, by slow progress and short journeys, reached
    Leicester Abbey. He was received with the greatest respect. His only observation was,
    "Father Abbot, I am come to lay my bones among you." He died three days after, with,
    great composure and fortitude. He said, shortly before his death&mdash;"Had I but
    served my God as diligently as I have served the king, he would not have forsaken me
    in my grey hairs; but this is the just reward I must receive for my pains and study,
    in not regarding my service to God, but only to my prince."</p>

    <p>Melancthon, a few days before his death, although extremely debilitated, delivered
    his usual lecture. At the termination of it, he said, impressively&mdash;"I am a
    dying man, and these are the three subjects for intercession with God, which I leave
    to my children and their little ones&mdash;that they may form part of his church, and
    worship him aright&mdash;that they may be one in him, and live in harmony with each
    other&mdash;and that they may be fellow-heirs of eternal life." The day before his
    death, he addressed some present&mdash;"God bestows talents on our youth, do you see
    that they use them aright." While dying, his friends discerned a slight motion of the
    countenance, which was peculiar to him when deeply affected by religious joy.</p>

    <h2>THE NOVELIST.</h2>

    <h3>OSMYN AND ZAMBRI.<br />
    <i>A Persian Tale. From the French.</i></h3>

    <h4>(<i>From a Correspondent.</i>)</h4>

    <p>A worthy old Persian having arrived at the end of an irreproachable life,
    experienced in his last moments the greatest uneasiness for the fate of his two sons,
    whom he was about to leave without fortune, without a livelihood, and without a
    prospect. The elder called Osmyn, was twenty years of age, and the younger, eighteen,
    bore the name of Zambri.</p>

    <p>As the old man drew near his last hour, he thought much less of his own sufferings
    than of the fate of his children, when his ear was agreeably struck with a soft and
    melodious voice, which said to him, "Fear nothing, old man, I will watch over your
    children; die in peace as thou hast lived. I bring a present for each of your sons;
    let them make good use of it, and one day perhaps they may be re-united, and live in
    happiness."</p>

    <p>At these words a balsamic odour spread itself in the cottage, and a bright light
    discovered to the view of the astonished Persian, the features of a young man, whose
    expressive countenance had in it something celestial. It was a beneficent genius, who
    after having deposited his presents on the bed of the old man, vanished like
    lightning. The old man called his two sons, they ran eagerly towards him with a
    light, and approached the bed of their father, who related to them the visit he had
    been honoured with, and showed them the presents of the genius. On one side was a
    small box covered with brilliant spangles; on the other a sheet of paper carefully
    sealed. "Come Osmyn," said the old man, "you are the eldest, it is for you to
    choose."</p>

    <p>Osmyn attracted by the richness of the box, chose it with eagerness, and poor
    Zambri was obliged to be contented with the humble envelope. The old man embraced
    them, blessed them, and died as one resigning himself to the arms of hope. After
    having wept sincerely the death of so good a father, and having rendered the last
    offices to his remains, the two brothers were anxious to know what aid they should
    find in the presents of the genius. Osmyn opened his little box and found it filled
    with pastilles of divers forms and colours. He was almost tempted to laugh at the
    meanness of such a gift, when he perceived these words written on the lid of the
    box&mdash;"<i>Each time that thou eatest one of these pastilles, thine imagination
    will bring forth a poem perfect in all its parts, sublime and delicate in its
    details, such in short as will surpass the ablest works of the best Persian
    poets.</i>"</p>

    <p>Osmyn did not want vanity; the possession of so fine a secret failed not to turn
    his young brain, and a hundred <span class="pagenum"><a name="page421"
    id="page421"></a>[pg 421]</span> illusions of fortune and glory presented themselves
    at once to his imagination.</p>

    <p>From the value of the present given by the genius to his brother, Zambri doubted
    not that his paper contained also some marvellous secret. He opened it and read with
    as much surprise as sorrow&mdash;"<i>A new Receipt for preparing Sherbet.</i>" Some
    lines pointed out the method of composing a liquor, of which one drop only being
    infused in a bowl of Sherbet, would give it a taste and perfume hitherto unknown to
    the most voluptuous Asiatics.</p>

    <p>Osmyn was overjoyed, and Zambri was in despair; Osmyn wished not to quit his
    brother, but the orders of the genius were imperative. The two brothers embraced each
    other tenderly, shed tears, and separated. The eldest took the road to Bagdad, where
    all the learned, and all the poets of Asia were assembled to attend the court of the
    Caliph. As to poor Zambri, he quitted the cottage of his father, carrying nothing
    with him but <i>the humble receipt for preparing Sherbet</i>, and leaving to chance
    the direction of his course.</p>

    <p>Before his arrival at Bagdad, Osmyn had already eaten half-a-dozen of the
    pastilles, and consequently carried with him half-a-dozen poems, beside which were to
    fade the productions of the greatest Eastern poets. But he soon found that pretenders
    to talent often succeed better than those who really possess it. He felt the
    necessity of connecting himself with literary men, and men of the world; but he only
    found them occupied with their business, their pleasures, or their own pretensions.
    Under what title could he present himself? Under that of a poet? The court and the
    city overflowed with them; they had already filled every avenue. To consult his
    fellows would be to consult his rivals; to ask their praises would be to ask a miser
    for his treasures. Besides, so many books appeared, that people did not care to read.
    However, Osmyn's works were published, but they were not even noticed in the
    multitude of similar productions.</p>

    <p>After having vegetated four or five years at Bagdad, without obtaining anything
    but weak encouragement given by wise men, (who are without influence because they are
    wise,) poor Osmyn began to lose the brilliant hopes that formerly had dazzled him.
    However, by dint of eating the pastilles, he at last attracted some notice. If it
    requires time for genius to emerge from obscurity, no sooner is it known than
    recompense is made for slow injustice. It is sought after not for itself, but for the
    sake of vanity. Envy often avails itself of it as a fit instrument subservient to its
    own purposes. Soon, in fact, the works of Osmyn only were spoken of, and after
    languishing a long time unnoticed, he saw himself at once raised to the pinnacle,
    without having passed the steps which lead from misery to fortune, from obscurity to
    glory.</p>

    <p>The Caliph desired to see so great a genius, and to possess him at his court.
    Osmyn was overwhelmed with favours; he sung the praises of the Caliph with a delicacy
    that other poets were far from being able to imitate. The Caliph admired delicate
    praise the more because it is rare at court.</p>

    <p>So much merit and favour besides, soon created the jealousy of other poets, and
    likewise of the courtiers. Even those, who had showed themselves the most
    enthusiastic admirers of Osmyn's talents, feared to see themselves eclipsed by this
    new comer, and resolved to destroy the idol they had raised so much higher than they
    wished.</p>

    <p>One of the poets, Osmyn's enemy, was employed to compose a satire against the
    Caliph, and it was agreed that this should be circulated under the favourite's name.
    From that time the avenger of the common cause never quitted Osmyn, nor ceased to
    load him with praises and caresses.</p>

    <p>One day when Osmyn delivered an extempore poem before the Caliph, his rival, after
    having warmly applauded him, cast down his eyes by accident, and saw shining on the
    floor one of the pastilles that Osmyn, who was led away by the vivacity of his
    declamation, had let fall by mistake. The traitor snatched it up, and put it
    mechanically in his mouth.</p>

    <p>The pastille produced its effect; the poet felt a sudden inspiration, left the
    hall and flew to compose the projected satire. He was surprised at his own aptitude;
    the verses cost him no trouble, but flowed of themselves. The bitterest expressions
    escaped from his pen without his seeking for them. In short, in an instant, he
    brought forth a true <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i> of malice.</p>

    <p>He continued some moments in ecstacy with his work, and carried it in triumph to
    his friends&mdash;or rather to his accomplices. The satire was received with the
    liveliest applause: it was the pure and vigorous style of Osmyn. The writer had
    imitated his handwriting; and soon the libel was spread about in his name.</p>

    <p>Murmurs arose on all sides against <span class="pagenum"><a name="page422"
    id="page422"></a>[pg 422]</span> the ingratitude of Osmyn. The satire fell into the
    hands of the Caliph, who in his rage ordered the unfortunate Osmyn to be stript of
    all his property, and driven from Bagdad. Osmyn, overpowered by the blow, could not
    defend himself; besides, how could he make his innocence heard amidst the cries of
    his calumniators.</p>

    <p>After having wandered a long time, every where imploring pity&mdash;sometimes
    meeting with kindness, but oftener repulsed with selfishness&mdash;he arrived, at
    nightfall, before a superb country house, magnificently illuminated. He heard the
    accents of joy mingled with the sounds of a brilliant concert of music, and saw all
    the signs of a splendid f&ecirc;te. However, the thunder began to roll, the sky was
    obscured by heavy clouds, and Osmyn's miserable clothing was soon drenched by the
    rain.</p>

    <p>He approached this beautiful house, in hopes to find there, if not hospitality for
    the night, at least an asylum for some minutes. The slaves perceived him, and said to
    him harshly&mdash;"What do you ask, beggar?"</p>

    <p>"A humble shelter from the storm, a morsel of bread to appease my hunger, and a
    little straw to rest my body on, borne down by fatigue."</p>

    <p>"Thou shalt have none of these."</p>

    <p>"For pity&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Begone!"</p>

    <p>"See how it rains!&mdash;Hear how it thunders!"</p>

    <p>"Go elsewhere, and come not to disturb by thy presence the pleasures of our
    master."</p>

    <p>Osmyn was on the point of obeying this order, when the master of the house, who
    had witnessed this scene from a window, came down, called his slaves, and ordered
    them to receive the unfortunate man, to procure him clothes, a bed, and all he was in
    need of. "Misery," said he, "misery is for him who revels in the presence of the
    poor, and suffers them to plead for assistance in vain; and misfortune for the rich
    who, cloyed with luxuries, refuse a morsel of bread to a famishing stranger. Poor
    traveller, go and repose thyself, and may the Prophet send thee refreshing slumbers,
    that thou mayst for a time forget thy sufferings."</p>

    <p>"Oh Heaven!" cried Osmyn, "what voice strikes my ear? It is the voice&mdash;the
    voice of Zambri!"</p>

    <p>"Zambri! what! do you know him?"</p>

    <p>"Heavens! do I know him?&mdash;Do I know my brother?"</p>

    <p>"You my brother!" cried Zambri in his turn. "Can it be? That voice&mdash;those
    features, disfigured by poverty and misery. Ah! I recognise you, my dear Osmyn!"</p>

    <p>No more need be said: he flew to embrace his brother; but Osmyn, overcome by the
    excess of his joy, fell senseless at his feet.</p>

    <p>He was conveyed into the finest apartment of the villa, every assistance was
    afforded him, and he was soon restored. Zambri ordered him magnificent apparel, and
    taking him by the hand, conducted him to the banquet, and presented him to his
    friends. After the repast, Osmyn related all the vicissitudes of his fortune, his
    long suffering, his rapid glory, the jealousy and perfidy of his enemies, "But thou,"
    added he, "my dear Zambri, by what good fortune do I find you in such an enviable
    situation? What! this beautiful house, this crowd of slaves, these sumptuous
    ornaments!&mdash;to what dost thou owe them?"</p>

    <p>"<i>To the receipt for preparing Sherbet,</i>" said Zambri, smiling. "Listen to my
    story, it is very simple. Soon after we parted, I directed my steps towards Teflis,
    where I sought only to gain a livelihood. On my arrival, I went into the public
    places where the opulent people assemble, to refresh themselves with ices and
    sherbet. I solicited employment there, but was refused, and harshly sent away. Not
    knowing what to do, and not having money to procure a subsistence, I went at length
    to one of the obscure caf&eacute;s, frequented by the lowest people. The master of
    this wretched place, who was named Mehdad, agreed to accept my services. I prepared a
    bottle of the liquor for which the good genius had given me the receipt, but the
    ingredients of which, although cheap, I had not before been able to purchase, and
    soon I found an immense company crowding to Mehdad's caf&eacute;. The rich people
    also would take no other; and Mehdad soon had before him the prospect of becoming
    opulent.</p>

    <p>"He had a daughter; she was young and beautiful; I became enamoured of her, and
    ventured to ask her hand. I had preserved the secret of my receipt. Mehdad was
    ignorant that he owed his good fortune to me, and believed that it was through his
    own talent. He rejected my offer with disdain, and drove me from his house. Poor
    fellow! he was not the first who, without knowing it, had driven good luck from his
    home.</p>

    <p>"I had gained some money in his service; and I employed the fruit of my economy in
    forming for myself an establishment in one of the public gardens of Teflis, on the
    banks of the charming <span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>[pg
    423]</span> river Khur. Here I erected a small, but elegant pavilion, and I sold my
    Sherbet to all the promenaders of the garden. In a short time Mehdad, and all the
    caf&eacute;s of Teflis, were abandoned for my little pavilion. Zambri's Sherbet was
    alone in demand: it was spoken of in all companies&mdash;it was taken at all
    festivals. The garden of Zambri was crowded from morning till night. The multitude
    was attracted towards my pavilion like swarms of flies towards a honey-comb. I was
    compelled to erect a pavilion ten times larger than the former, and I decorated it
    magnificently.</p>

    <p>"A year had scarcely elapsed before I had acquired a considerable fortune. I
    quitted my new establishment, returned to the city, and purchased merchandize of all
    descriptions. I prepared a great quantity of this favourite liquor, to which I owe
    all my wealth. I sent it to all the cities of Persia, and into the most distant
    countries. Heaven seemed to smile on my exertions. A beautiful widow, aged twenty
    years, saw and loved me; I was not insensible to her charms. We made mutual vows of
    attachment, and marriage crowned my happiness.</p>

    <p>"We have acquired this charming retreat, and reside here during the most beautiful
    season of the year, amongst our good friends, who, in partaking our pleasures, add to
    them the charms of their society.</p>

    <p>"How many times, dear Osmyn, have my thoughts been occupied with thee! Often have
    I said, in the midst of my prosperity, Where is my brother?&mdash;where dwells Osmyn?
    No doubt the invaluable secret he possesses has gained him an immense fortune, and
    raised him to the pinnacle of honour. But I see that in these times happiness,
    tranquillity, and perhaps riches, are more easily obtained by humble and modest
    employment, than by splendid abilities. In the course of my transactions, I have met
    with vexations and disappointments. Sometimes my Sherbet has been imitated; but the
    fraud has always been discovered, and the intrigues of my rivals have added to my
    reputation. At length I have found that it is easier to satisfy the caprice than the
    judgment of mankind, and that those who could not understand the merits of a clever
    work, would readily agree upon the subject of a delicious and agreeable
    beverage."</p>

    <p>Thus spoke the good Zambri: he strove affectionately to console Osmyn. The two
    brothers separated no more; and, thanks to the <i>receipt for preparing</i>
    <i>Sherbet</i>, they lived long together amidst the pleasures that wealth commands,
    and the still more true and solid happiness procured by peace and friendship.</p>

    <h3>BOTANY OF SHAKSPEARE.</h3>

    <p>At a recent meeting of the Medico-Botanical Society, a very interesting
    dissertation on the medicinal plants which occur in the plays of Shakspeare, from the
    pen of Mr. Rootsay, of Bristol, was read, and excited considerable attention. The
    hebenon henbane alluded to in <i>Hamlet</i>, the mandragora, the various plants so
    beautifully alluded to in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, and in other dramas, were the
    subject of the inquiry, and much classical information was displayed by the ingenious
    author in the illustration of the subject. We hope to report more respecting this
    very interesting paper to our readers.</p>

    <p>The following account of the <i>sepia media</i>, a small species of cuttle-fish,
    is given by Mr. Donovan, in his "Excursion through South Wales:"&mdash;"When first
    caught, the eyes, which are large and prominent, glistened with the lustre of the
    pearl, or rather of the emerald, whose luminous transparency they seemed to emulate.
    The pupil is a fine black, and above each eye is a semilunar mark of the richest
    garnet. The body, nearly transparent, or of a pellucid green, is glossed with all the
    variety of prismatic tints, and thickly dotted with brown. At almost every effort of
    respiration, the little creature tossed its arms in apparent agony, and clung more
    firmly to the finger; while the dark-brown spots upon the body alternately faded and
    revived, diminishing in size till they were scarcely perceptible, and then appearing
    again as large as peas, crowding, and becoming confluent nearly all over the body. At
    length, the animal being detained too long from its native element, became enfeebled,
    the colours faded, the spots decreased in size, and all its pristine beauty vanished
    with the last gasp of life."</p>

    <h3>RUSSIAN BURIAL GROUND.</h3>

    <p>Mr. James's popular Journal of a Tour in Russia, &amp;c., has supplied the above
    illustration of honours paid to the dead in that country. The Cut represents one of
    the Cemeteries of the government of Tchernigoff. Mr. James describes it as planted
    around with trees, and studded thick with wooden crosses, oratories, and other
    permanent marks of reverence. The general appearance of piety with which these
    grounds are kept up, their sequestered situation apart from any town, the profound
    veneration with which they are saluted by the natives, added to the dark and
    sepulchral shade of the groves, lend them an interest with which the tinsel ornaments
    of more gorgeous cemeteries can in no degree compare.</p>

    <h3>ANCESTORS.</h3>

    <p>Some nations pay particular attention to the memory of their ancestors. The
    Quojas, a people of Africa, offer sacrifices of rice and wine to their ancestors,
    before they undertake any considerable action; and the anniversaries of their death
    are always kept by their families with great solemnity; the king invokes the souls of
    his father and mother to make trade flourish and the chase succeed. But the Chinese
    have distinguished themselves above all other nations, by the veneration in which
    they hold their ancestors. Part of the duty, according to the laws of Confucius,
    which children owe their parents, consists in worshipping them when dead. They have a
    solemn and an ordinary worship for this purpose, the former of which is held twice a
    year with great pomp, and is described as follows by an eye witness:&mdash;The
    sacrifices were made in a chapel, well adorned, where there were six altars,
    furnished with censers, tapers, and flowers. There were three ministers, and behind
    them two young acolites: he that officiated was an aged man, and a new Christian. The
    three former went with a profound silence, and made frequent genuflexions towards the
    five altars, pouring out wine; afterwards they drew near to the sixth, and when they
    came to the foot of the altar, half bowed down, they said their prayers with a low
    voice. That being finished, the three ministers went to the altar; the priest took up
    a vessel full of wine, and drank; then he lifted up the head of a deer, or goat;
    after which, taking fire from the altar, they lighted a bit of paper, and the
    minister of ceremonies turning towards the people, said, with a high voice, that he
    gave them thanks in the name of their ancestors, for having so well honoured them;
    and in recompense he promised them, on their part, a plentiful harvest, a fruitful
    issue, good health and long life, and all those advantages which are most pleasing to
    men.</p>

    <p>The Chinese have also in their houses a niche, or hollow place, in which they put
    the names of their deceased fathers, to which they make prayers and offerings of
    perfumes and spices at certain periods.</p>

    <h3>HISTORY OF POLAND.</h3>

    <p>This volume, a goodly octavo, will be peculiarly acceptable at the present season.
    It presents a lucid view of Polish history, from the earliest period to the present
    eventful moment; and, as a passage of immediate interest, we quote the following
    character of the President of the National Government of Poland:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This illustrious personage, Prince Adam Czartoryski, is the eldest son of the
      late prince of the same house, and is descended from the family of Jagellon, the
      ancient sovereigns of Lithuania. His father was long known, not only as a nobleman
      of the first rank in Poland, but as one of the most accomplished scholars in
      Europe. Such was his reputation, that at the period of the last vacancy in the
      throne of Poland, Poniatowski (afterwards king) was deputed by the diet to
      propitiate the Empress Catherine, to second the election of Czartoryski; but the
      deputy's handsome form found such favour in the licentious eyes of the modern
      Messalina, that he ceased to urge the suit of the diet, and returned the avowed
      nominee of his imperial mistress. Prince Czartoryski's claims on the throne,
      popularity, and consequent influence, rendered him odious to the court of St.
      Petersburg, and when the last act of spoliation was perpetrated, his lands were
      ravaged, his beautiful Castle of Pulawy destroyed, and a sentence of extermination
      pronounced against him, unless he would consent to send his two sons, one the
      subject of this notice, and the other Prince Constantino Czartoryski, as hostages
      to St. Petersburg. To avoid this wretched alternative, the prince and his princess,
      who still survive, consented to the separation, and the two young noblemen, were
      placed under the eye of those who were deemed worthy, by the Autocrat, of reforming
      their principles. The talents displayed by both brothers soon obtained for them the
      admiration of the court; and as it was of great importance to gain them over, every
      mark of imperial favour was heaped upon them by the Emperor Alexander, with whom,
      from infancy, they had established terms of the utmost familiarity. The elder
      brother held for a long time the portfolio of the Foreign Office, and, in his
      official capacity, accompanied his imperial master to the scenes of some of his
      most serious disasters. During Napoleon's invasion, Prince Constantino was in
      Poland, and confiding in the integrity of the then master of the destinies of
      Europe, and breathing naught but freedom for his country, he joined the banners of
      the invader, and raised a regiment at his own expense to aid in the cause of
      liberation. At Smolensk he received a severe wound, from the effects of which he
      has never yet recovered. He resides at Vienna.</p>

      <p>The influence of Prince Adam Czartoryski proved to be singularly useful to
      Poland after the downfall of Napoleon. He interposed, and interposed successfully,
      between the anger of Alexander and his suffering country; and, on the establishment
      of the kingdom of Poland, was appointed the curator of all the universities, both
      there and in the incorporated provinces. These duties he sedulously discharged,
      until he was superseded by the notorious Count Novozilzoff. From this period he has
      lived in retirement, faithfully performing all the duties of private life. The
      promotion of agriculture, science in all its branches, and kindly offices among
      mankind, constituted his occupations until recent events drew him from his privacy.
      The first call was made by the Russian functionaries, as stated in the text, for
      the purpose of self-protection! the second was that of his devoted country, when a
      government was essential to success. He was chosen not only one of the five members
      of the executive body, but its president, a station which he still honourably
      fills. Into his new office he has carried all the unostentatious and disinterested
      virtues that adorned Pulawy, and there is little doubt that if (and no one suspects
      that such will not be the case) the independence of Poland be fairly won, the
      choice of his country will point to him as its sovereign. Having finished his
      academical career at the University of Edinburgh, he early acquired a strong taste
      for English institutions and for Englishmen, and of this he gave substantial proof
      by devoting 250<i>l.</i> a-year to the exclusive purchase of English books. His
      revenues are enormous; but his liberality is unbounded; and, as it is a rule in his
      munificent establishment to provide liberally for the families of all his
      dependants, his means are comparatively restricted, but his personal wants are few;
      and that he is ready to accommodate himself to circumstances, was well shown by his
      only observation on hearing of the confiscation of his large property in Podolia by
      Nicholas. "Instead of riding, I must walk, and instead of sumptuous <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>[pg 426]</span> fare, I must
      dine on buck-wheat."<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a
      href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> Such is a faint outline of this illustrious
      man's character. Were it only for the admirable example of such an individual
      guiding the reigns of the government of a devoted people, it is most ardently to be
      hoped that Poland may triumph over her enemies, and be raised to that rank from
      which she was degraded only by the basest of treasons.&mdash;<i>Fletcher's History
      of Poland.</i></p>

    <p>As the pronunciation of the Polish language is attended with some difficulty, the
    author of this work has, in his advertisement, subjoined the following hints, taken
    principally from the "Letters Literary and Political on Poland, Edinburgh, 1823."</p>

    <p>All vowels are sounded as in French and Italian; and there are no diphthongs,
    every vowel being pronounced distinctly. The consonants are the same as in English,
    except</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>w</i>, which is sounded like <i>v</i>, at the beginning of a word; thus,
      Warsawa&mdash;<i>Varsafa</i>; in the middle or at the end of a word it has the
      sound of <i>f</i>, as in the instance already cited; and
      Narew&mdash;<i>Nareff</i>.</p>

      <p><i>c</i>, like <i>tz</i>, and never like <i>k</i>; thus, Pac is sounded
      <i>Patz</i>.</p>

      <p><i>g</i>, like <i>g</i> in Gibbon; thus, <i>Oginski</i>.</p>

      <p><i>ch</i>, like the Greek [Greek: ch] or <i>k</i>; thus,
      Lech&mdash;<i>Lek</i>.</p>

    <h3>WHITE'S BAMPTON LECTURES.</h3>

    <p>Dr. Dibdin has prefixed the subsequent Note to one of these Lectures (Character of
    Christ compared with that of Mahomet), which he has reprinted in vol. iii. of the
    <i>Sunday Library</i>:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Of all the sermons preached in this, or in any other country, THESE are perhaps
    the most celebrated; or, if this observation require qualification, the only
    exception may be in favour of those of the <i>Petit Car&ecirc;me</i> of MASILLON. For
    three successive terms, the church of St. Mary's, at Oxford, was crowded with an
    auditory breathless in admiration of the splendour of diction and vividness of
    imagery manifested in these discourses. The subject treated of&mdash;'<i>A Comparison
    of Mahometanism and Christianity in their History, their Evidences, and their
    Effects</i>'&mdash;was new and striking in the pulpit of the University Church. A
    great deal of highly wrought expectation, from more than a whisper spread abroad of
    the sources whence the chief materials had been derived, preceded their publicity;
    and the preacher, although by no means remarkable for elegance of manner, or
    ductility and melody of voice, applied his whole energies to the task of giving power
    and effect to his delivery. He succeeded, greatly beyond his own expectations; and
    the University rung with his praises. The fame which ensued was merited; for the
    public, till then satisfied with the tame polish and cold invective of BLAIR, became
    delighted by the union of such harmony of language, skilfulness of argument, and
    singularity of research, as were blended in these lectures. Yet it may be questioned,
    not only whether a display of similar talent would <i>now</i> receive the like
    applause, but whether many subsequent courses of Bampton lectures have not rendered a
    more essential service to Christianity.</p>

    <p>"But, extraordinary as was the result of the <i>preaching</i> of these Bampton
    lectures, perhaps a more extraordinary history belongs to their <i>composition</i>;
    and posterity will learn, with wonder, and perhaps with mingled pity and contempt,
    that the measures resorted to by the Laudian Professor of Arabic, in order to impose
    upon his best friend and most able coadjutor, DR. PARR, form such a tissue of petty
    artifice and intrigue as scarcely to be believed. The whole plot, however, is
    minutely and masterly developed in Dr. Johnstone's <i>Life of Dr. Parr</i>, vol. i.
    p. 216-281, to which I refer the curious reader for some very singular particulars.
    The facts, as there delineated, are simply these:&mdash;A secret correspondence was
    carried on between Professor White and Mr. Badcock, a dissenting minister of
    Devonshire, who furnished the greater part of the materials of these lectures; which
    materials, copied out by Professor White, with a few emendations and additions, were
    sent to Dr. Parr as the exclusive composition of the Professor. Several of the
    lectures are wholly Badcock's, by the express admission of Dr. White; and the
    undeniable evidence of a douceur of 500<i>l.</i> from the Professor to Mr. Badcock,
    is a sufficiently solid proof of the value in which the former held the labours of
    the latter. There could be no violation of any great moral feeling in the transaction
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>[pg 427]</span> thus simply
    considered; for the labourer was worthy of his hire; but the evasive subtleties and
    shuffling subterfuges by which the literary intercourse was stubbornly denied, and
    attempted to be set aside, by Professor White, is matter of perfect astonishment! In
    the mean while, Dr. Parr steadily continued his critical labours, believing that the
    Professor sought no <i>aid</i> but his <i>own</i>. He revised, added, and polished at
    his entire discretion; and while it is allowed that <i>one-fifth</i> at least, of
    these lectures are the work of his learned hand, he undoubtedly gave to the whole its
    last and most effectual polish. The history which belongs to his discovery of the
    collateral aid of Badcock, is curious and amusing; but can have no place here. It
    does great credit to the head and heart of Dr. Parr. Thus the reader will observe
    that no small interest is attached to the volume from which the ensuing extracts are
    made: a volume, full, doubtless, of extensive and learned research, and exhibiting a
    style remarkable alike for its consummate art and harmonious copiousness."</p>

    <h3>WEALTH OF HENRY VII.</h3>

    <p>The hoard amassed by Henry, and "most of it under his own key and keeping, in
    secret places at Richmond," is said to have amounted to near 1,800,000<i>l.</i>,
    which, according to our former conjectures, would be equivalent to about
    16,000,000<i>l.</i>; an amount of specie so immense as to warrant a suspicion of
    exaggeration, in an age when there was no control from public documents on a matter
    of which the writers of history were ignorant. Our doubts of the amount amassed by
    Henry are considerably warranted by the computation of Sir W. Petty, who, a century
    and a half later, calculated the whole specie of England at only
    6,000,000<i>l.</i>&mdash;This hoard, whatever may have been its precise extent, was
    too great to be formed by frugality, even under the penurious and niggardly Henry. A
    system of extortion was employed, which "the people, into whom there is infused for
    the preservation of monarchies a natural desire to discharge their princes, though it
    be with the unjust charge of their counsellors, did impute unto Cardinal Morton and
    Sir Reginald Bray, who, as it after appeared, as counsellors of ancient authority
    with him, did so second his humours as nevertheless they did temper them. Whereas
    Empson and Dudley, that followed, being persons that had no reputation with him,
    otherwise than by the servile following of his bent, did not give way only as the
    first did, but shaped his way to those extremities for which himself was touched with
    remorse at his death."<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a
    href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> The means of exaction chiefly consisted in the
    fines incurred by slumbering laws, in commuting for money other penalties which fell
    on unknown offenders, and in the sale of pardons and amnesties. Every revolt was a
    fruitful source of profit. When the great confiscations had ceased, much remained to
    be gleaned by true or false imputations of participation in treason. To be a dweller
    in a disaffected district, was, for the purposes of the king's treasure, to be a
    rebel. No man could be sure that he had not incurred mulcts, or other grievous
    penalties, by some of those numerous laws which had so fallen into disuse by their
    frivolous and vexatious nature as to strike before they warned. It was often more
    prudent to compound by money, even in false accusations, than to brave the rapacity
    and resentment of the king and his tools. Of his chief instruments, "Dudley was a man
    of good family, eloquent, and one that could put hateful business into good language;
    Empson, the son of a sieve-maker, of Towcester, triumphed in his deeds, putting off
    all other respects. They were privy counsellors and lawyers, who turned law and

    subservient judges imposed enormous fines, and the king imprisoned during his own

    <h2>SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY.</h2>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>THE COURSE OF THE NIGER.</h3>

    <p>The discovery of the termination of the course of the Niger, will be of the
    greatest importance to geography, to our political power, and to civilization.</p>

    <p>With regard to geography, perhaps the contradiction which was afforded by the
    various sources whence we derived our knowledge of the character of the interior of
    Africa, and of the course of, next to the Nile, the most renowned, and, as was
    considered from the same accounts, the greatest river of that country, have in late
    times given unlimited zest in the pursuit of further information, and has not in the
    least detracted from the pleasure with which we find that we are indebted to our
    countrymen for the solution of this all-absorbing problem. It appears, that among the
    ancients many facts connected with the geography of the interior of Africa were well
    known, which have still been an object of discussion among the moderns; and of these,
    we may enumerate the occurrence of a large lake or marsh (for it is either, at
    different seasons of the year), whose real existence, beyond the speculations of
    geographers, was very unsatisfactorily established, until the journey of Denham and
    Clapperton; and the fact of the occurrence of a great river in the west, emptying
    itself into the ocean, though many were of opinion that it lost itself in an inland
    marsh, or in the desert, while others supported the opinion of its identity with the
    Nile of the Egyptians. The researches of Ptolemy and the Arabian geographers on the
    Nile of the Negroes, and in later times the travels of Leo Africanus, who was a Moor
    of Grenada, demonstrated the absurdity of this opinion; and how extraordinary that,
    in the boasted perfection of human intellect, it should have been broached several
    centuries afterwards, and that the barometric levellings of Bruce should have been
    necessary to enforce conviction! It is not at all improbable that Hanno, the
    Carthaginian, as advanced by Macqueen, reached the Bight of Benin, or of Biafra; and
    certainly the geographical information obtained on these countries by Herodotus and
    Edrisi was more accurate than the speculations of many modern geographers.</p>

    <p>Observation had demonstrated to the moderns that no large river emptied itself
    into the ocean on the north-west coast, though it required a more accurate
    acquaintance with the Senegal and the Gambia before it was fully ascertained that
    they were not the outlets of this great stream. The progress of navigation along the
    south-eastern shores of Africa also showed that no large river emptied itself into
    the sea along that coast; while the settlements of the Portuguese on the coast to the
    south of Cape Lopez, led them, at an early period, to adopt the opinion afterwards
    supported by Mungo Park and Mr. Barrow, that one or more of the rivers in their
    vicinity were the outlets of the great river of the interior of Africa. Two
    celebrated geographers, D'Anville and Major Rennell, however, espoused the theory of
    the waters emptying themselves into the Wangara, or great marsh; which argument
    underwent various modifications in the hands of different geographers; and though the
    probability of its emptying itself into the Gulf of Guinea had been pointed out on
    the continent, and vigorously supported in this country, an expedition was fitted out
    to explore the Congo or Zaire, which, though unfortunate to the individuals
    concerned, was yet satisfactory in a geographical point of view, and demonstrated
    that the rivers south of Cape Lopez were not the outlets of the waters of the Niger,
    and gave origin to a speculation which partook of all the characters of a romance of
    the desert, beneath the sands of which its author buried the gigantic stream, loaded
    with the waters of the Wangara or Lake Tchad, to make it flow into the Mediterranean
    at the Syrtis of the ancients.</p>

    <p>In the history of geography there are no examples of greater perseverance and
    courageous determination than in the efforts made to triumph over the difficulties
    presented in the solution of this important question. Since 1815, there has scarcely
    a year passed in which a new attempt has not been made; and of these, if we recede a
    little farther back, twenty-five were made by our countrymen, fourteen by Frenchmen,
    two by Americans, and one by a German; of which but a small number, since the days of
    Houghton, have not fallen victims to their heroic devotion.</p>

    <p>Mungo Park first observed the direction of the stream which had become as much an
    object of discussion as its termination; and, strange to say, after the present
    discovery, it will, in some parts of its course, still remain so. The <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>[pg 429]</span> unfortunate
    traveller just alluded to, previous to his descent of the river, obtained some
    information from Moors and from negroes, on its course by Timbuctoo. The Jinnie of
    Park is synonymous with Jenn&eacute;, Gin&eacute;, Dhjenn&eacute;, of other writers,
    as Jenn&eacute; has again been confounded with Kano or Kanno. It may be a figurative
    term&mdash;for the Jinnie of Park was on an island, as was the Jenn&eacute; of the
    Moorish reports, while the Jenn&eacute; of some travellers is at a short distance
    from the river. This cannot be the case with regard to Timbuctoo, which is visited by
    caravans twice a year from Morocco; nor is the name met with any where, except the
    two first syllables in the town of Timbo, which cannot be mistaken for Timbuctoo.</p>

    <p>Major Laing had discovered the source of the Niger to be in the mountains of Loma,
    in 9 deg. 15 min. west latitude, and had ascertained its course for a short distance
    from its source. We were also aware of the existence of one or two streams joining
    the great river, or branching from it near Timbuctoo. De Lisle had marked a river
    Gambarra, on his maps drawn up for Louis XV., and not without good authority. This is
    the river coming from Houssa; and the Joliba of modern travellers is a river, we
    could prove, from the concurring testimony of a variety of sources, coming from the
    north-west, and joining its waters with, that is to say flowing into the Niger, in
    the immediate neighbourhood of Timbuctoo; still at that point the Kowarra, or Quorra
    of the Moors, or Quolla of the Negroes, who always change the <i>r</i> for <i>l</i> a
    name which, according to Laing, it has at its sources&mdash;according to Clapperton,
    it preserves beyond Timbuctoo, and is probably still the name of the same stream at
    its embouchure in the Bight of Biafra. The Quarrama is another tributary stream which
    passes by Saccatoo, and falls into the Quorra above Youri, and above the point where
    Mungo Park was wrecked; and the line of country between this river and the Shashum,
    comprising the hills of Doochee, of Naroo, and of Dull, is the line of water-shed to
    the rivers joining the Quorra on the one hand, and those emptying themselves into the
    Wangara on the other. The course given by Sultan Bello, and the information obtained
    by Major Denham, both pointed out a river coursing to the east, which is probably the
    branch followed by the Landers: for its termination in Lake Tchad had not even the
    air of probability; though it is not, on the other-hand, at all improbable that other
    branches empty themselves into the Bight of Benin, by the rivers Formosa or Volta,
    according to information given to Captain Clapperton and Major Laing.</p>

    <p>We had intended to embody some remarks upon the pretended journey of
    Cailli&eacute;; but we find we have already occupied too much space in details
    necessary to make the geographical nature of the question well understood; and we
    shall content ourselves with remarking, that the discovery of the termination of the
    Quorra, or Niger, tends to throw a degree of improbability upon the narrative of that
    individual, which it will require much ingenuity to explain away. It is certain that
    the latitude given to Timbuctoo by the editor of those travels, and upon which
    sufficient ridicule has already been thrown in the Edinburgh Geographical Journal,
    may be considered as an error entirely of the editor's, who, by taking it upon
    himself, will relieve the burden of the mistake from the traveller, and thus lighten
    the weighty doubts which might in consequence bear upon the remainder of the details;
    for the situation of that city, as given by Jomard, is quite inconsistent with the
    situation it must be in, from the ascertained source, direction, and termination of
    the river. There can be no doubt but that a portion of the labours presented to the
    public as the travels of Cailli&eacute; are founded upon valid documents, wherever
    obtained, and probably most of the errors are those of the editor. But though
    authorities can be found in support of the division of the Quorra into two branches;
    one of which, the Joliba, flows to the north-west, and the other in an almost
    opposite direction,&mdash;fact which has no analogy in geography, and, what is
    better, no existence in nature; yet no authority can be found for placing Timbuctoo
    on a river flowing north from the Niger.</p>

    <p>The details which will be given to us by the results of this successful expedition
    will, then, not only be of assistance in allying the existing condition of things
    with the knowledge of the ancients, but it will enable us to reduce to a few facts
    the many contradictory statements which have originated in the variety of the sources
    of information, and the individual and national rivalry which the interest of the
    question gave birth to among the geographers of the present day. It will also be of
    importance, as it was connected with a great question, as to the possibility of a
    large river traversing an extensive continent, or losing itself in a marsh or lake,
    or being buried in the extensive sands of the desert. By <span class="pagenum"><a

    us, it will increase our political strength and commercial advantages on those
    coasts;&mdash;it will enable us to put into practice an amelioration long
    contemplated by Mr. Barrow, in the choice of our settlements on those
    coasts;&mdash;it will place the greatest and most important vent of the barbarous and
    inhuman traffic of negroes in our possession; and it will enable us to diffuse the
    benefits of superior intelligence among an ignorant and suffering

      <h3>GAD'S HILL.</h3>

      <p>Gad's Hill, not far from Chatham, was formerly a noted place for depredations on
      seamen, after they had received their pay at the latter place. The following
      robbery was committed there in or verging on the year 1676: About four o'clock one
      morning, a gentleman was robbed by one Nicks, on a bay mare, just as he was on the
      declivity of the hill, on the west side. Nicks rode away, and as he said, was
      stopped nearly an hour by the difficulty of getting a boat, to enable him to cross
      the river; but he made the best use of it as a kind of bait to his horse. From
      thence he rode across the county of Essex to Chelmsford. Here he stopped about an
      hour to refresh his horse, and give the animal a ball;&mdash;from thence to
      Braintree, Bocking, and Withersfield; thence over the Downs to Cambridge; and from
      thence, keeping still the cross roads, he went by Fenny Stratford, <a
      id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> to
      Godmanchester and Huntingdon, where he and his mare baited about an hour; and, as
      he said himself, he slept about half an hour: then holding on the north road, and
      keeping a full gallop most of the way, he came to York the same afternoon; put off
      his boots and riding clothes, and went dressed as if he had been an inhabitant of
      the place, to the bowling-green, where, among many other gentlemen, was the Lord
      Mayor of the city. He, singling out his lordship, studied to do something
      particular that the mayor might remember him, and then took occasion to ask him
      what o'clock it was. The mayor, pulling out his watch, told him the time, which was
      a quarter before, or a quarter after eight at night. Upon a prosecution for this
      robbery, the whole merit of the case turned upon this single point:&mdash;the
      person robbed, swore to the man, to the place, and to the time, in which the
      robbery was committed; but Nicks, proving by the Lord Mayor of York, that he was as
      far off as <i>Yorkshire</i> at that time, the jury acquitted him on the bare
      supposition, that the man could not be at two places so remote on one and the same
      day.</p>

      <p>I need not remind your numerous readers that the roads in 1676 were in a very
      different plight to those of 1831; at the former period it would not have been
      possible for Tom Thumb to have trotted sixteen miles an hour on any turnpike road
      in England. Even my friend, the respected driver of the Old Union Cambridge Coach
      to London, can remember, in his time, the coach being two days on the road, and
      occasionally being indebted to farmers for the loan of horses to drag the coach
      wheels out of their sloughy tracks.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
